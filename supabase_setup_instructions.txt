SUPABASE DATABASE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================

Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
- Go to your Supabase project dashboard
- Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
- Click "New Query"

Step 2: Copy the SQL Script
- Open the file "supabase_setup.sql" in this folder
- Select ALL the content (Ctrl+A)
- Copy it (Ctrl+C)

Step 3: Paste and Execute
- Paste the SQL script into the Supabase SQL Editor
- Click the "Run" button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
- You should see "Success. No rows returned" message

Step 4: Verify Tables Created
- Go to "Table Editor" in Supabase
- You should see two new tables:
  * subjects
  * attendance_records

Step 5: Check Authentication Settings
- Go to "Authentication" â†’ "Settings"
- Set Site URL to: http://localhost:3000
- Enable email confirmations (recommended)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you get permission errors, make sure you're using the correct project
- If tables already exist, the script will skip creating them (that's normal)
- If you see syntax errors, make sure you copied the entire script

NEXT STEPS:
1. Save your .env file with correct Supabase credentials
2. Run: npm install
3. Run: npm run dev
4. Open: http://localhost:3000

Your database is now ready for the AttendTrack application!
